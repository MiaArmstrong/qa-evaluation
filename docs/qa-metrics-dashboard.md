# If I were to stand up a QA Metrics Dashboard for our Feature Flags Admin tool, here’s what I’d do and why it matters

## 1. Pick 4–6 core KPIs

  - Test pass rate (passed vs. total tests)

  - Flake rate (how often tests fail once then pass)

  - Coverage % (lines/branches exercised by unit, integration & E2E)

  - PR feedback time (time from PR open to CI pipeline complete)

  - Open bug count by severity (correlate real issues to coverage gaps)

## 2. Automate metric collection

  - Generate JSON reports from our Mocha/Mochawesome runs

  - Run nyc/c8 for coverage output

  - Use a small Node script (or GitHub Action) to parse those outputs and push numeric metrics into a time‑series store (e.g. Prometheus Pushgateway or DataDog)

## 3. Visualize in Grafana

  - Connect Grafana to Prometheus/DataDog

  - Build simple panels:

  - Gauge for coverage %

  - Line chart for pass & flake rates over time

  - Stat panel for PR feedback latency

  - Bar chart for open bugs by priority

## 4. Embed into CI/CD

  - In our GitHub Actions e2e job, after tests finish:

    - Emit metrics (node emit‑metrics.js)

    - Push to the metrics backend

  - Dashboards auto‑update on every PR or nightly run

## 5. Why this matters

  - Visibility: Everyone—from product to execs—can see how our test suite and coverage are trending

  - Accountability: We can set goals (e.g. 80% coverage) and measure progress

  - Reliability: Early detection of flaky tests or CI slowdowns

  - Data‑driven: Tie real bugs back to coverage gaps and prioritize automation work
